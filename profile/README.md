🌟 Yamota | Custom ROM Developer & Android Enthusiast

Hi, I’m Yamota—a developer deeply immersed in the world of Android custom ROMs and device bring-ups. I love taking Android devices to their full potential by creating smooth, stable, and feature-rich custom ROMs tailored to users’ needs.

🚀 What Drives Me
For me, custom ROM development isn’t just a hobby—it’s a way of bringing new life to devices, giving users more freedom, and exploring the limitless possibilities of open-source software. Whether it’s reviving older devices or enhancing the capabilities of the latest hardware, my goal is to deliver optimized and user-friendly ROMs that stand out.

🔧 What I Work On
Device Bring-Ups: Starting from scratch to make Android run smoothly on a device. Adapting BSPs, kernel debugging, and crafting device trees to ensure compatibility.

HAL Integration: Creating and modifying hardware abstraction layers to fully utilize device features.

Vendor & Device Tree Development: Extracting, porting, and optimizing vendor blobs, proprietary libraries, and configuration files.

Kernel Tweaks & Debugging: Enhancing performance and fixing issues at the core level for a more stable experience.

SEPolicy & Security: Fine-tuning SELinux policies to balance security and functionality.

Custom ROM Maintenance: Building and maintaining ROMs like LineageOS, ensuring they are regularly updated and compatible with evolving Android standards.

🌟 Why Open Source?
I strongly believe in the power of the open-source community. Sharing knowledge, collaborating with developers, and contributing to projects drive innovation and make Android better for everyone.

📂 My Work
I actively work on bring-ups, vendor customizations, and kernel enhancements for various Android devices. You’ll find me tackling challenges like porting newer versions of Android to unsupported devices, optimizing SEPolicy configurations, and improving overall ROM performance.

🤝 Collaboration Opportunities
I’m always eager to connect with fellow developers and enthusiasts. Whether it’s contributing to a ROM, sharing insights, or troubleshooting a device, I’m all for teamwork. Let’s combine our skills to push the boundaries of Android development.
