Hi! Iâ€™m Yamota, a custom ROM developer who loves working on Android devices. My focus is on bring-upsâ€”getting new ROMs running on unsupported devicesâ€”and optimizing them for better performance, security, and stability.

Iâ€™ve spent countless hours tweaking SEPolicy, fixing kernel issues, and working on device trees to make sure everything just works. Itâ€™s challenging, but thereâ€™s nothing more rewarding than seeing a device boot up with a custom ROM Iâ€™ve worked on.

What I Love Doing:
Device Bring-Ups: Taking a device from "no ROM support" to fully operational.

Custom ROM Development: Building smooth, feature-packed experiences.

Debugging & Optimizing: Fixing issues and making things run better than ever.

Iâ€™m all about the open-source community. Sharing knowledge, collaborating, and helping others improve their devices are what keep me going.
